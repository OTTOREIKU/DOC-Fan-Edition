# DOC-Fan-Edition
A fan made Derby Owners Club *adjacent* game for the terminal

=============

This is a terminal step/text based version of a Derby Owners Club *like* game. I say like because I've added in some systems that I enjoyed in other racing games and other systems I just wanted to test out and play around with. At its core it's built with the love I had for the original Derby Owners Club. This was built to run in a Windows 11 Terminal so I'm not sure how the icons and colors will translate to other operating systems.
  
I've tried to balance the overall feel and pacing of the early, mid, and late game but it still needs work. I have not tested playing with generation 5+ as much so im sure this area needs more/better balancing. For now I've slowed development of it as I've begun working on porting it up to GoDOT to build in some animations and eventually spin it into its own game. I am not a proficient coder or game developer so I've used AI to do the heavy lifting in a lot of areas because I simply wanted to make a game that I could spend hours playing and assume I will probably be the only user. If you happen to stumble upon this and want to test it out and give me feedback on various parts of it I would absolutely take those to heart.

### Features:  

*(some of the features you have to purchase from the store to be able to use)*  
  
- Market  
Dynamic marketplace generating random horses every month to purchase. New markets appear once you breed new generations of horses.  
  
- Active Stable / Racing  
Choose a horse and take on races throughout the month with dynamic random events. Train your horse in between weeks to build up their stats.  

- Tension / Strain system  
Build tension by strategically holding your horse and unleash it when whipping. Whipping your horse will build strain and cause the horse to use extra stamina. Release strain by holding, coasting, or urging. Mix in different actions to balance these two.  
  
- Breeding / Genetics  
Fairly in depth breeding with systems built to pass down genetic markers, boss titles, and maximum potential stats. Currently supporting Generations 0-10 with Gen 6+ having legendary colors & coats.  
  
- Farm / Riding Academy  
Retired horses live on the farm and contribute lifetime earned titles to give bonuses to the entire stable. Move your horse over to the Riding Academy to help train other horses and make extra monthly income based on the stats of the horse at retirement.  
  
- Store  
Tons of facility upgrades, gear, and consumables. 
  
- Hall of Fame  
Keep track of your retired horses and see which titles are giving bonuses to your entire stable. See which of your horses have contributed the most to your dynasty.  
  
- Compendium  
General rules and conditions are housed here as well as an area to keep track of discovered titles and what they do along with bosses. Preview discovered rare coats/colors.  

- Bosses  
Handful of powerful boss horses that have a low chance to spawn in your races. Beat them to take their titles and gain permanent buffs.  
  
- Trading Hub  
Import or Export horses (Active and Retired) to trade with other players or simply generate a card for your collection. Horse trading data is encoded to the metadata of the generated PNG image so you can simply send someone the card file and the game can import directly from that. This is still a work in progress but I tried to emulate the physical cards from DOC.  
  
- Jockey System  
This is a work in progress and not at a place that I am fully happy with. It is disabled by default but you can turn it on in the settings if you want to try it. Once enabled it will add a new area to the compendium where you can get more info on it.  
  

=============  

Once you buy your first horse from the market the game will create your stable.json file **in the same location as the EXE** so keep that in mind if you end up moving your game to a new location. When using the Trade Hub to generate cards the game will **make a new 'cards' folder in the same location as the EXE** as well.

This is a passion project for educational and entertainment purposes that has no relation to Derby Owners Club or SEGA branding other than in name
